    `First decide category as EXACTLY one of: ${CATEGORIES.join(", ")}.`,
    `Then, based on that category, return subcategory (this is the garment's TYPE — e.g. "T-Shirt", "Wrap Dress" — NEVER a length or heel height, those are separate fields below) as EXACTLY one value from the list for that SAME category — never mix values from a different category:\n${SUBCATEGORY_MAP_TEXT}\nAlways give your best guess from the matching category's list rather than leaving it empty. Return an empty string only if the garment type is genuinely ambiguous even after picking a category.`,
    `Shoes specifically: "Sneakers" and "Running Shoes" are NOT interchangeable — pick "Running Shoes" for anything that reads as a technical/performance training or running shoe (chunky foam midsole, mesh technical upper, visible cushioning technology like an air unit or foam wedge, bold color-blocking typical of a running model) even if the label or brand also happens to make lifestyle shoes. Pick "Sneakers" only for a clean lifestyle/fashion silhouette (minimal court shoe, canvas, leather, low-profile sole) meant to be worn as a style piece, not for exercise.`,
        `Return colors as an array (1-3 items) picked EXACTLY from this fixed palette (use these names verbatim): ${COLOR_NAMES.join(", ")}. Pick the closest matches; never invent color names. If the garment is visibly patterned or printed (florals, stripes, checks, animal print, tie-dye, a busy multi-color print) rather than a single dominant solid color, lead with the matching pattern name from the Multicolor family (Animal Print, Floral, Striped, Checkered, Denim Wash, Tie Dye) instead of listing the individual solid colors within the print — a floral dress should get "Floral", not "Pink, Green, Blue". Only list solid colors when the piece genuinely reads as solid or has a small, secondary accent (e.g. a plain top with a striped collar can still list its main solid color, with "Striped" added only if the stripe is a defining visual feature).`,
       `Return styles as an array (0-3) from: ${STYLES.join(", ")}. This is the piece's AESTHETIC identity — reason from its silhouette, fit, material and color palette (all attributes you're already assessing below), not from a vague overall impression: Minimal (clean lines, neutral/monochrome colors, no ornamentation); Editorial (bold silhouette or a statement color/print, fashion-forward rather than everyday); Quiet luxury (refined plain basics, muted neutral tones, no visible branding, quality fabric like wool/cashmere/silk); Street (oversized or relaxed fit, sneakers, denim, graphic/logo prints, casual technical fabrics); Romantic (soft flowing fabric, ruffles/florals/lace, pastel or soft colors); Tailored (structured, fitted, sharp precise cuts — blazers, trousers with a clean line); Bohemian (flowing/layered silhouette, earthy tones, natural textured fabric like linen/suede, prints or fringe); Sporty (athletic cut, technical/stretch fabric, sneakers-adjacent); Vintage (a cut or print distinctly evocative of a past decade rather than current). Style, occasion and formality are three separate dimensions — don't let one drive the others: style is aesthetic identity, occasion is when/where it's typically worn, formality is purely how dressed-up it reads. A Sporty-style piece can still suit Everyday or Weekend occasions at low formality; a Tailored piece isn't automatically Formal occasion or high formality (e.g. tailored joggers are Tailored style, Everyday occasion, low formality).`,
    `Return occasions as an array (0-3) from: ${OCCASIONS.join(", ")}.`,
        `Return seasons as an array from: ${SEASONS.join(", ")}. NEVER combine "All Seasons" with a specific season in the same answer — pick either "All Seasons" alone, or 1-3 specific seasons, never both. Reason from the garment's material, coverage and weight rather than guessing: heavy insulating materials (Wool, Cashmere, Shearling, Down, Alpaca, thick fleece) or covering outerwear (coats, heavy jackets, boots) → Autumn/Winter; lightweight breathable materials (Linen, thin Cotton, thin Viscose) or minimal-coverage pieces (shorts, tank tops, sandals, swimwear) → Spring/Summer. Reserve "All Seasons" for genuinely versatile mid-weight basics with no strong material or coverage signal pointing to a specific time of year (e.g. plain cotton t-shirt, straight jeans, a simple leather bag, classic sneakers) — it is not a fallback for uncertainty, and most garments should get a specific 1-2 season pick rather than "All Seasons".`,
        `Return materials as an array (1-2) from: ${MATERIALS.join(", ")}. Always give your best guess — materials power season matching and outfit suggestions, and the user can correct them before saving. Combine visible texture cues (sheen, weave, grain, knit stitches) with what this garment type is typically made of (t-shirts and shirts → Cotton; jeans and denim jackets → Denim; tailored blazers and coats → Wool, Polyester or Viscose; flowing dresses and blouses → Viscose, Silk, Linen or Polyester; chunky sweaters → Wool, Cashmere, Merino or Acrylic depending on visible fiber thickness and sheen; sporty/technical pieces → Polyester, Polyamide or Elastane; boots and belts → Leather or Suede; watches, jewelry and metal hardware → Metal, Steel, Gold, Silver or Pearl). "Knit" describes a construction technique, not a fiber — never return it as a material even if the garment is visibly knitted; name the actual fiber instead. Return an empty array only if the item is genuinely impossible to assess (e.g. heavily obscured or not a garment).`,

    "Return brand if you can identify the commercial brand with confidence, for ANY brand — not just well-known luxury houses, and not limited to the kind of mark shown in any example below. Two independent signals count, and a single garment may show either or both: (1) readable brand text/wordmark printed on a label, hangtag, woven tag or the garment itself; (2) a graphic/symbolic logo you recognize even without text — an animal, a geometric shape, a monogram, an abstract mark, a stitched emblem, or any other symbol a fashion brand uses as its mark. Some brands print their name as plain text, some use only a symbol, and some (like Patrizia Pepe, whose label often shows just a stylized bee) use a symbol as their primary mark with the name only elsewhere — treat these as equally valid identification paths, not a hierarchy. Look closely at every logo/mark in the image before deciding it's unidentifiable — a small monogram or symbol on a label is very often a recognizable brand mark, not decoration. Only return an empty string if you genuinely don't recognize the brand from either signal; never guess or invent a brand name you're not confident about, and never confuse a manufacturer/company name (see detectedManufacturer below) for the brand — a manufacturer name printed in plain text on a label is a DIFFERENT thing from the brand's logo, even when the manufacturer name is the only text visible.",
