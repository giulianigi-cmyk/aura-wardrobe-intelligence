/**
 * Analyzes the user's real wardrobe and suggests ONE genuinely missing

 * under-represented given what they already own. This does NOT invent a
 * specific product, brand, or price (an LLM can't know what's actually
 * for sale) - it names a TYPE of piece with real reasoning. The list of
 * items it would pair with is computed HERE from the real wardrobe (not
 * asked of the model), so it references real, existing pieces - never a
 * fabricated count or fabricated items.
 *
 * Two hard, code-level guarantees (not just prompt instructions):
 * 1. The suggestion is checked against what's actually owned
 *    (category + subcategory + color) - if the model proposes something
 *    already owned, it's rejected and the model is asked again, up to
 *    MAX_ATTEMPTS times. If no genuine gap is found, we say so honestly
 *    instead of forcing a bad suggestion.
 * 2. "Would pair with" only pulls from categories that make sense as
 *    outfit companions (never Underwear/Activewear/Swimwear), ranked by
 *    real color-compatibility logic (neutrals pair with everything, same
 *    family scores well) instead of literal same-name color matching or
 *    an arbitrary fallback slice of the wardrobe.
