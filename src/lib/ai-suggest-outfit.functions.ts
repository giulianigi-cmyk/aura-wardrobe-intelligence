Going over this isn't a hard stop, just a sign to double check the extra colors are earning their place rather than accumulating by accident.",

This is only about the two leather accessories relative to each other, not to the rest of the outfit — black shoes with a brown dress, sweater, or trousers is completely normal and not a deviation from anything. And even shoes-vs-bag mismatched tones (e.g. brown dress + black shoes + burgundy bag) can work when the overall palette reads as deliberately coordinated rather than accidental — this is a preference to weigh, not a requirement to enforce mechanically.",
